# GitHub Actions

We provide official GitHub Actions to incorporate resources into your CI/CD pipeline. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Setup database

The `querydesk-setup-action` is used to setup a database in your QueryDesk instance. For example this can be useful for automating the setup of databases for preview environments.

## Remove database
