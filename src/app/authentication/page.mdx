# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the API. QueryDesk uses API keys for authentication, which provide secure access to your organization's resources. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## API Keys

Each API key is associated with a specific organization and can be used to manage settings through Terraform and official GitHub Actions.

### Getting an API Key

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to your organization's settings in the app
2. **API Keys Section**: Click on the "API Keys" tab in the settings
3. **Create New Key**: Click the "New API key" button
4. **Name Your Key**: Provide a descriptive name for your API key
5. **Copy the Token**: Once created, copy the generated API key token immediately - you won't be able to retrieve it again

Remember that API keys have full access to your organization's resources, so treat them with the same security as your account password.

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with all API requests:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with API key' }}
curl https://xxx.devhub.cloud/api/v1/endpoint \
  -H "x-api-key: dh_xxx"
```

### API Key Format

Devhub API keys are prefixed with `dh_` followed by your token.
