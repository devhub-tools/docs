# Terraform

Most resources in QueryDesk can be managed through Terraform. You can find the Terraform provider here: [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/devhub-tools/devhub/latest/docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/devhub-tools/devhub/latest/docs). {{ className: 'lead' }}

If you need to manage resources that are not supported by Terraform yet, please reach out to support@devhub.tools.
