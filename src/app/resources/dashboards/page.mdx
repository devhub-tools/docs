# Dashboards

Dashboards allow you to visualize and monitor your data in a centralized location. On this page, we'll dive into the different dashboard endpoints you can use to manage dashboards programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete dashboards. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
Dashboards can also be managed with Terraform using the official provider: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/devhub-tools/devhub/latest/docs/resources/dashboard
